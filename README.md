# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
Predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using various machine learning models


# Telecom Churn Prediction Project
## Description
This project predicts customer churn in the telecom sector using machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest. The project explores the key factors influencing customer retention and builds predictive models for churn analysis.

## Project Structure

Data Preparation: Data cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and data encoding.
EDA: Visualizations and analysis to understand customer characteristics.
Modeling: Building and evaluating multiple models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest).
Deployment: The final model was deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web application.

## Technologies Used

Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Streamlit for deployment
